It ranges from 0 to 1:\n\n- $P(A) = 0$: The event $A$ will definitely not happen.\n- $P(A) = 1$: The event $A$ will definitely happen.\n- Values between 0 and 1 represent varying degrees of likelihood.\n\n## Everyday Examples\n- What's the probability it will rain tomorrow?\n- What are the chances of rolling a 6 on a standard die?\n- How likely is it that a randomly chosen student has a GPA above 3.0?\n\n\n## Key Terms and Definitions\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### **Experiment**\nAn action or process that generates outcomes.  \n- Example: Rolling a die.\n\n### **Sample Space**\nThe set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.  \n- Example: For rolling a die, $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n\n### **Event**\nA subset of the sample space, representing outcomes of interest.  \n\n- Example: Rolling an even number ($A = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$).\n\n### **Prob. of an Event**\nThe proportion of times an event is expected to occur if the experiment is repeated many times.\n\n:::\n\n## The Probability Formula\n\nThe probability of an event $A$ is defined as:\n\n$$\nP(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}\n$$\n\n## Example\n\nIf we roll a die, what is the probability of rolling a 4?\n\n- **Favorable outcomes**: 1 (rolling a 4).\n- **Total outcomes**: 6 (since $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$).\n\n$$\nP(\\text{rolling a 4}) = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.167\n$$\n\n\n## Rules of Probability\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Rule 1\n\n**Probability of the Sample Space**\n\nThe probability of the sample space is always 1:\n$$\nP(S) = 1\n$$\n\n### Rule 2 \n\n**Probability of Impossible Events**\n\nThe probability of an event that cannot happen is 0:\n\n$$\nP(\\emptyset) = 0\n$$\n\n### Rule 3\n\n**Complement Rule**\n\nThe probability of the complement of an event $A$ (not $A$) is:\n\n$$\nP(A^c) = 1 - P(A)\n$$\n\n- Example: If $P(\\text{rain}) = 0.3$, then $P(\\text{no rain}) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$.\n\n\n:::\n\n## Applications\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Drawing a Card\nIf you draw a card from a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing:\n\n1.

It's a way to map the outcomes of a probabilistic event to numbers. This allows us to analyze these outcomes mathematically.\n\n## RV: Key Concepts\n\n* **Random Phenomenon:** This is any process or experiment whose outcome is uncertain. \n\n* **Outcomes:** The possible results of a random phenomenon are called outcomes. \n\n* **Numerical Value:** A random variable assigns a numerical value to each outcome. \n\n## Types of Random Variables\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Discrete Random Variable \n\nA discrete random variable can only take on a finite number of values or a countably infinite number of values. The values are often integers. Examples:\n\n- The number of heads in three coin flips (0, 1, 2, or 3).\n- The number of defective light bulbs in a box of 100.\n- The number of customers entering a store in an hour.\n\n### Continuous Random Variable\n\n A continuous random variable can take on any value within a given range. Examples:\n\n- The height of a person.\n- The temperature of a room.\n- The time it takes to complete a task.\n\n:::\n\n\n## Distribution Functions\n\nA **distribution function** describes the probabilities of a random variable across its possible values. It answers questions like:\n\n- How likely is a random variable to take on a specific value or fall within a range?\n- What is the overall \"shape\" of the distribution of outcomes?\n\n## Cumulative Distribution Function\n\nThe **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** describes the probability that a random variable $X$ is less than or equal to a certain value $x$:\n$$\nF_X(x) = P(X \\leq x)\n$$\n\n## Properties of the CDF\n\n1. **Range**: The CDF is always between 0 and 1:\n   $$\n   0 \\leq F_X(x) \\leq 1\n   $$\n2. **Non-Decreasing**: The CDF never decreases as $x$ increases.\n3. **Limits**:\n   - $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} F_X(x) = 0$\n   - $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} F_X(x) = 1$\n\n## CDF Example\n\nFor a die roll (discrete case):\n\n- $F_X(2) = P(X \\leq 2) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6}$.\n\nFor a normal distribution (continuous case):\n\n- Use the CDF to find probabilities, typically provided via tables or software.\n\n\n## Probability Density Function (PDF)\n\nThe **Probability Density Function (PDF)** is used for **continuous random variables** and describes the likelihood of the variable falling within a small interval.\n\n$$\nP(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_a^b f_X(x) \\, dx\n$$\n\n\n::: fragment\n::: callout-important\n$$\nP(X = a) = P(a \\leq X \\leq a) = \\int_a^a f_X(x) \\, dx = 0\n$$\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Properties of the PDF:\n\n1. **Non-Negative**:\n   $$\n   f_X(x) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall x\n   $$\n\n2. **Total Area Under Curve**:\n   $$\n   \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f_X(x) \\, dx = 1\n   $$\n\n## PDF Examples\n\nThe PDF of the normal distribution is:\n$$\nf_X(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation.\n\n\n\n## Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n\nThe **Probability Mass Function (PMF)** is used for **discrete random variables** and gives the probability of each possible value:\n$$\nP(X = x) = p_X(x)\n$$\n\n## Properties of the PMF\n1. **Non-Negative**:\n   $$\n   p_X(x) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall x\n   $$\n\n2. **Sum of Probabilities**:\n   $$\n   \\sum_x p_X(x) = 1\n   $$\n\n## PMF Example\n\nFor a fair die, the PMF is:\n$$\np_X(x) = \\frac{1}{6}, \\quad x \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\n$$\n\n## Percentiles\n\nA **percentile** is a measure indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations falls. It is used in statistics to provide information about the relative standing of a particular value within a dataset.\n\n## Percentile Example\n\nSuppose we have a random variable X representing the height of adults in a population. If the 90th percentile of X is 180 cm, it means that the probability of a randomly selected adult being 180 cm or shorter is 90%.\n\n## Precentile\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\ndata <- rnorm(500000, mean = 100, sd = 15) |> data.frame(x = _)  # Example: normally distributed data\n\n# Calculate the 75th percentile\npercentile_75 <- qnorm(0.75, 100, 15)\n\nggplot(data = data, aes(x = x)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"skyblue\", alpha = 0.5) +  # Density curve\n  geom_vline(xintercept = percentile_75, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Density Plot with 75th Percentile Highlighted\", x = \"Data Value\", y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](5_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Applications\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### PMF of a Coin Toss\nFor a fair coin tossed once:\n\n- $X = 0$: Tails, $P(X = 0) = 0.5$\n- $X = 1$: Heads, $P(X = 1) = 0.5$\n\nThe PMF is:\n$$\np_X(x) = \n\\begin{cases} \n0.5 & x = 0 \\text{ or } x = 1 \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\n### CDF of an Exp.

**Mean ($\\mu$)**: The center or peak of the distribution.\n  - **Standard Deviation ($\\sigma$)**: Controls the spread of the distribution.\n\n\n::: fragment\n::: callout-important\nFor any normally distributed data, the highest probability density is at the mean, and as you move away from the mean, the probability density gradually decreases.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Properties\n\n\n1. **Symmetry**: It is perfectly symmetric about the mean, meaning the left side is a mirror image of the right.\n2. **Unimodal**: There is a single peak at the mean.\n3. **Mean, Median, and Mode are Equal**: In a normal distribution, these three measures of central tendency are located at the same point.\n4. **68-95-99.7 Rule** (Empirical Rule)\n\n::: notes\n\nThis rule helps us understand how data is distributed in a normal curve and provides a quick way to estimate probabilities for normally distributed data.\n\n:::\n\n## Normal Distribution\n\n\n::: {.column}\n\n$$\nX\\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)\n$$\n\n$$\n-\\infty < X < \\infty\n$$\n\n:::\n::: {.column}\n\n$$\nf_X(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\n$$\n\n:::\n\n\n## The Standard Normal Distribution\n\nThe **Standard Normal Distribution** is a special type of normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It's often used as a reference to convert any normal distribution to a standard form.\n\n## Z-Scores\nA **Z-score** (or standard score) tells us how many standard deviations an individual data point is from the mean. It’s calculated as:\n\n$$\nZ = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n$$\n\n- If $Z$ is positive, the data point is above the mean.\n- If $Z$ is negative, the data point is below the mean.\n- Using Z-scores, we can compare values across different normal distributions or find the probability associated with a particular score.\n\n\n## Why the Normal Distribution is Important\n\n\n1. **It Describes Many Natural Phenomena**: Heights, weights, test scores, measurement errors, and countless other variables follow a normal distribution, especially when influenced by many small, random factors.\n2. **Predictive Power**: With normally distributed data, we can make predictions and infer probabilities, thanks to the 68-95-99.7 rule.\n3. **Central Limit Theorem**: The normal distribution is foundational to the Central Limit Theorem, which tells us that, regardless of the original data distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution as sample size increases.\n4. **Ease of Use in Statistical Methods**: Many statistical tests and methods assume normality, allowing for simplified calculations and reliable inferences.\n\n\n## Apps of the Normal Dist.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Standardized Testing\nScores on standardized tests, such as IQ tests or the SAT, are often designed to follow a normal distribution. By knowing a student’s score in terms of Z-scores, we can determine their percentile or how they compare to other test-takers.\n\n### Finance\nIn finance, stock returns and other economic factors are often modeled with a normal distribution to estimate risk, forecast trends, and make informed investment decisions.\n\n:::\n\n## Finding Probability\n\n$$ \nX \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma)\n$$\n\n::: fragment\n\n$$\nP(a \\leq X \\leq b) = P(a < X < b) = \\int_a^b \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} dx\n$$\n\n:::\n\n\n# Empirical Rule\n\n\n## What is the Empirical Rule?\n\nThe **Empirical Rule** provides a way to understand the spread of data in a normal distribution by describing how data points cluster around the mean. According to this rule:\n\n1. Approximately **68%** of data points fall within **one standard deviation** of the mean.\n2. Approximately **95%** of data points fall within **two standard deviations** of the mean.\n3. Approximately **99.7%** of data points fall within **three standard deviations** of the mean.\n\nThe empirical rule is very helpful because, with just the mean and standard deviation, we can quickly estimate how data is distributed within a normal curve.\n\n\n## Empirical Rule to the Normal Dist.\n\nLet's define the key terms and apply the empirical rule to the normal distribution.\n\n- **Mean (μ)**: This is the central point of the normal distribution where the data clusters around.\n- **Standard Deviation (σ)**: This is a measure of how spread out the data points are from the mean.\n\n## Empirical Rule to the Normal Dist.\n\nIn a normal distribution:\n\n- **68% of data** lies between $(\\mu - \\sigma)$ and $(\\mu + \\sigma)$.\n- **95% of data** lies between $(\\mu - 2\\sigma)$ and $(\\mu + 2\\sigma)$.\n- **99.7% of data** lies between $(\\mu - 3\\sigma)$ and $(\\mu + 3\\sigma)$.\n\nThese intervals allow us to estimate probabilities for data within each range without needing to calculate exact probabilities.\n\n\n## Visualizing the Empirical Rule\n\nTo better understand the empirical rule, imagine a symmetric, bell-shaped normal curve. Here’s how it would look based on the empirical rule:\n\n1. The **68% region** represents the middle of the curve, starting one standard deviation left of the mean and ending one standard deviation right.\n2. The **95% region** stretches further out, covering almost the entire curve except for the outer tails.\n3. The **99.7% region** includes nearly all data points, covering the entire curve except for a tiny fraction at each extreme.\n\nThis visualization shows how the data is most concentrated around the mean, with less data appearing as we move further away.\n\n\n## Using the Empirical Rule for Probabilities\n\nThe empirical rule helps us answer questions like:\n\n- **What percentage of data points fall within a certain range?**\n- **How unusual is a data point located far from the mean?**\n\n## Examples\n\n- If we know that a data point lies more than two standard deviations away from the mean, we know it’s in the outer 5% of the distribution, making it relatively rare.\n- Using the rule, we can estimate that around 95% of values should lie within two standard deviations of the mean. If we observe data points outside of this range, we might consider them outliers.\n\n\n## More Examples\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Exam Scores\nSuppose exam scores are normally distributed with a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 10.\n\n- **68% of students** scored between **60 and 80** (70 ± 10).\n- **95% of students** scored between **50 and 90** (70 ± 20).\n- **99.7% of students** scored between **40 and 100** (70 ± 30).\n\n### Heights of Adults\nAssume that adult heights follow a normal distribution with a mean height of 170 cm and a standard deviation of 8 cm.\n\n- **68% of adults** have heights between **162 cm and 178 cm** (170 ± 8).\n- **95% of adults** have heights between **154 cm and 186 cm** (170 ± 16).\n- **99.7% of adults** have heights between **146 cm and 194 cm** (170 ± 24).\n\n:::\n\n# Binomial Distribution\n\n## Binomial Distribution\n\nThe **Binomial Distribution** is a probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of trials, where each trial has:\n\n- **Two possible outcomes**: typically called \"success\" and \"failure.\"\n- A constant probability of success, $p$, on each trial.\n\n## Real-World Examples:\n\n- Tossing a coin $n$ times and counting how many heads you get.\n- Rolling a die $n$ times and counting how many times you roll a 6.\n- Administering a medical treatment to $n$ patients and recording how many recover.\n\n::: fragment\n\nThe binomial distribution answers questions like:\n\n- \"What is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin tosses?\"\n- \"What is the likelihood of at least 4 successes in 10 trials?\"\n\n:::\n\n## Conditions for a Binomial Experiment\n\n\n1. **Fixed Number of Trials** ($n$):\n   - The experiment consists of a set number of trials.\n\n2. **Two Possible Outcomes**:\n   - Each trial results in either a success (e.g., heads) or a failure (e.g., tails).\n\n3. **Constant Probability of Success** ($p$):\n   - The probability of success remains the same for each trial.\n\n4. **Independence**:\n   - The outcome of one trial does not affect the outcomes of other trials.\n\n\n\n## The Binomial Probability Formula\n\n$$\nP(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n\n- $P(X = k)$: Probability of exactly $k$ successes.\n- $n$: Number of trials.\n- $k$: Number of successes.\n- $p$: Probability of success on a single trial.\n- $1-p$: Probability of failure.\n- $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$: Represents the number of ways to choose $k$ successes from $n$ trials\n\n\n\n## Example Calculation\nSuppose you flip a fair coin 5 times ($n = 5, p = 0.5$) and want to know the probability of getting exactly 3 heads ($k = 3$).\n\n::: fragment\n$$\nP(X = 3) = \\binom{5}{3} (0.5)^3 (1-0.5)^{5-3}\n$$\n\n:::\n\n## Properties of the Binomial Dist.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Mean and Variance\nFor a binomial random variable $X$:\n\n- **Mean (Expected Value)**: $\\mu = n \\cdot p$\n- **Variance**: $\\sigma^2 = n \\cdot p \\cdot (1-p)$\n- **Standard Deviation**: $\\sigma = \\sqrt{n \\cdot p \\cdot (1-p)}$\n\n### Shape of the Distribution\n\n- If $p = 0.5$, the distribution is symmetric.\n- If $p > 0.5$, the distribution is skewed left.\n- If $p < 0.5$, the distribution is skewed right.\n\n:::\n\n## Applications\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Quality Control\nA factory produces lightbulbs, and 95% of them meet quality standards.
