There will be no make ups for these writing prompts.\n\n\n\nNotebook assignments are designed to expand your statistical knowledge. These will be completed in Google Colab which can be accessed from Canvas. There is one notebook assignments every week that you can be completed during class time. Notebook assignments will be due on Wednesday at 11:59 PM every week.\n\n\n\nReading assignments are designed to teach you different statistical concepts. As the course progresses, many of the concepts build on each other. Therefore, the assignments encourage you to read each chapter in an appropriate amount of time. You must read the chapter and answer the questions by the Friday night at 11:59 PM. The 3 lowest reading assignments will be dropped.\n\n\n\nVideos are used to teach statistical concepts related to the course. Students are expected to watch at least one video a week. The videos are implemented using VoiceThreads. The 3 lowest video assignments will be dropped. Video assignments will be due every Sunday at 11:59 PM.\n\n\n\nHomework assignmets are designed to give you an opportunity to practice what is viewed from the video assignments. The assignments will require you to program in R. The 3 lowest homework assignments will be dropped. Homework assignments will be due every Sunday at 11:59 PM.\n\n\n\nThere will be three in exams. Exam #1 will be on March 3, Exam #2 will be on April 7, and Exam #3 will be on May 12 at 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM (Sec 01) or May 14 1-3 PM (Sec 02). While the exams are not considered cumulative, the material builds on each other. Developing a strong understanding of the material through out the course is important for your success. At the end of the semester, your lowest exam grade will be replaced by your median average exam grade. This course will operate under a zero-tolerance policy. Talking during the time of the exam, sharing materials, looking at another students’ exam, or not following directions given will be subject to the University’s academic integrity policy.\n\n\n\nThere will be 4 extra credit opportunities worth a total of 10% of your overall grade. (There are no make-ups for missed extra credit assignments!) More information will be provided on the extra credit assignments on a later date. Information on the extra credit can be found here.\n\n\n\n\nThe following outline may be subject to change.

For assignments and quizzes that allow you to work with a group, only put your name on what the group submits if you genuinely contributed to the work. Work completely independently on exams, using only the materials that are indicated as allowed. Failure to observe academic honesty results in substantial penalties that can include failing the course.\nDisabilities:\nIf you are a student with a disability requesting reasonable accommodations in this course, you need to contact Disability Accommodations and Support Services (DASS) located on the second floor of Arroyo Hall, via email accommodations@csuci.edu or call 805-437-3331. All requests for reasonable accommodations require registration with DASS in advance of need: https://www.csuci.edu/dass/students/apply-for-services.htm. Faculty, students and DASS will work together regarding classroom accommodations. You are encouraged to discuss approved.\nEmergency Procedure Notice to Students:\nCSUCI is following guidelines and public orders from the California Department of Public Health and Ventura County Public Health for the COVID-19 pandemic as it pertains to CSUCI students, employees and visitors on the campus. Students are expected to adhere to all health and safety requirements as noted on the University’s Spring 2023 Semester website or they may be subject to removal from the classroom."
