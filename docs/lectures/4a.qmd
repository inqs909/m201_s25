# Summary Statistics

## Summary Statistics

Summary statistics are used to describe the distribution of data.

## Central Tendency

Central tendency is a statistical concept that refers to the central or typical value around which a set of data points tends to cluster. It is used to summarize and describe a data set by identifying a single representative value that provides insights into the data's overall characteristics.

## Variation

Variation in statistics refers to the extent to which data points in a dataset deviate or differ from a central tendency measure. Understanding variation is crucial for making informed decisions, drawing meaningful conclusions, and assessing the reliability of statistical analyses.

## Minimum

The minimum (min) is the smallest value in the data.

## Maximum

The maximum (max) is the largest value in the data.

## Quartiles

::: fragment
Quartiles are three values (Q1, Q2, Q3) that divides the data into four subsets.
:::

:::

## Q1

Q1 is the value signifying that a quarter of the data is lower than it.

## Q2 - Median

Q2 is the value signifying that half of the data is below it.

::: fragment
The median also represents the central tendency of the data.
:::

## Q3

Q3 is the value signifying that 3 quarters of the data is below it.

## Interquartile Range

::: fragment
$$
IQR = Q_3 - Q_1
$$

## Range

$$
R = \mathrm{max} - \mathrm{min}
$$

## How to identify the data?

1.  Sort the data
2.  ID Max and Min
3.  Find the amount of data the makes a quarter:
    1.  $K=N/4$
4.  Create 4 groups using the sorted data
    1.  group by data size
    2.  If $K$ has a decimal, the $Kth$ value is quartile of each group.

## Mean

Describe how you will find the mean of these numbers:

```{r}
#| echo: false

rpois(5, 15)

```

## Mean

The mean is another measurement for central tendency.

$$
\bar X = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}X_i
$$

-   $n$: total data points

-   $X_i$: data points

-   $i$: indexing data

-   $\sum$: add all from first (bottom) to last (up)

## Variance

## Variance

The variance is a measurement on the average squared distance the data points are from the central tendency.

$$
s^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}(X_i-\bar X)^2
$$

## Standard Deviation

The standard deviation is a measurement on the average distance the data points are from the central tendency.

$$
s=\sqrt{s^2}
$$

# Data Visualization

## Histogram

A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution or frequency of data points in a dataset. It provides a visual way to understand the shape, central tendency, and spread of a dataset by dividing the data into intervals or bins and showing how many data points fall into each bin.

## Histogram R Code

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

gf_histogram(~bill_length_mm, data = penguins)
```

## Histogram

```{r}
penguins |> gf_histogram(~bill_length_mm, data = _) |> 
  gf_labs(title = "Histogram of Bill Length", x = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_barbie()
```

## Box Plot

A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a graphical representation of the distribution and key statistical characteristics of a dataset. It provides a visual summary of the data's central tendency, spread, and potential outliers.

## Box Plot

## Box Plot R Code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

gf_boxplot(~bill_length_mm, data = penguins)

```

## Box Plot

```{r}
penguins |> ggplot(aes(bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Box Plot of Bill Length") +
  theme_futurama()
```
