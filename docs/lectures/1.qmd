::: notes
-   What is the current knowledge of penguins?
-   How do we gain new knowledge of penguins?
-   Can anything we learn about this penguin be applied to other penguins?

# Data

## Observations

An observation is the unit which contains information to be obtained.\

::: fragment
Also known as experimental unit.
:::

## Data

Data is information from a particular experimental unit. There can be more that one piece of information per experimental unit.

## Data Structure

The structure of the data can be represented in various forms:

-   A list of long numbers

-   Table

## Tabular Form

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
palmerpenguins::penguins |> 
  DT::datatable(options = list(dom = "t",
                pageLength = 4))

```

# Measurements

## Measurements

Measurements are the processes where we represent an attribute of an experimental unit as either a number or category.

## Quantitative Measurements

Quantitative measurements are data measurements that take a numeric form.

## Qualitative Measurements

Qualitative measurements are data measurements that take a certain category.

## Value

A value is a description (number or category) of a specific attribute of an experimental unit.

## Variable

A variable is the descriptive attribute that we want to obtain from an experimental unit. In terms of a data set, the variable contains all the values of specific attribute in a sample.
