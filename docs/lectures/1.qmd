-   With an increasing use of data to make decisions, Statistics has been essential for processing large amounts of data to byte-size information

-   Statistics is also known as

    -   Data Science

    -   Machine Learning

    -   Artificial Intelligence

-   So for today, we're asking: **what is Statistics?**

## What does Google say?

### UC Irvine

Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Wikipedia

Statistics is a mathematical body of science that pertains to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data, or as a branch of mathematics.

### ChatGPT

Statistics is a branch of mathematics and a field of study that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.

## What do researchers say?

::: panel-tabset
## Anthropologist

Objectively interpreting data to make meaningful inferences about our predictions.

## Microbiologist

Whatever the statistician says.

## Sociologist

Gathering the narratives of individuals, groups, or society and telling a story about their past, present, or future. The numbers paint a picture worth many words.

## Political Scientist

Using numbers to try to explain behaviors and/or patterns in our world.

## Ecologist

Statistics is the way to make sense of the natural world by taking data we collect to identify patterns between variables, and applying statistical theory to make sure we are taking the right approach to data collection and analysis. Also, assess patterns to see if they are reproducible and provide a logical explanation that makes biological sense.

## Mathematician

Statistics is the study of data, patterns, and trends.

## What does a Statistician say?

It is the study of variation and randomness!

::: fragment
Using mathematics, we model randomness to characterizes commonality and variation!
:::

::: fragment
Using science, we systematically refine models to better fit randomness in data!
:::

::: fragment
Using art, when it all eventually fails!

## When it fails?!?!

## What is the formal definition of Statistics?

Statistics is both the development of mathematical models to be used in real-world data and the analysis of data using existing models.

## What's the goal of a Statistician?

::: {.fragment style="font-size: 2em; color: red;"}
**INFERENCE**
:::

::: fragment
Use our sample data to understand the larger population.
:::

::: fragment
The data will tell us how the population generally behaves.
:::

::: fragment
The data will guide us in the differences in units.
:::

::: fragment
Data will tell us if there is a signal or just noise.

## Conducting Inference

## Are we seeing something or is it just noise???

Are we seeing something different from what was expected? Or is it due to random chance?

## Hypothesis Testing

::: incremental
1.  Set up the Null and Alternative Hypothesis
2.  Construct a test statistic based on the null hypothesis
3.  Construct a distribution of the test statistic based on probability theory
4.  Compute the probability of observing the test statistic
5.  Make a decision based on the probability
:::

## What if we cannot construct the distribution?!?!

We bring out the **Monte Carlo** methods!
:::
::::
:::::::

## Monte Carlo Methods

-   Monte Carlo Methods are used to construct a distribution function of an obscure test statistic
-   We simulate a large number of data sets based on the null hypothesis
-   We construct a test statistic for each fake data set and the real one
-   We count how many data sets produce a test statistic that is more extreme than the real test statistic
-   $p=\#\ of\ extreme\ data\ sets\ /\ all\ data\ sets$

## Overview of Research

::: incremental
1.  Ask a question about a population
2.  Collect data from a sample
3.  Construct and test a hypothesis
4.  Draw conclusion about the population
5.  Refine your question and methodology
:::

## So, what is Statistics?

## Train of Thoughts

::: fragment
There are two train of thoughts on how to interpret estimates and probability.
:::

::: fragment
One approach is the Frequentist approach.
:::

::: fragment
The other approach is the Bayesian approach.
:::

::: fragment
Both sides hate each other.
:::

## Frequentists

## Frequentists

A frequentist, in the context of statistics, is an individual who adheres to the frequentist interpretation of probability and statistical inference.

::: fragment
Meaning probability is obtained by the repetition of multiple experiments.
:::

## Bayesians

![](https://media.tenor.com/ncl2k1KRsQgAAAAC/mystic-team-mystic.gif){fig-alt="Symbol from Team Mystic From Pokemon appearing" fig-align="center"}

## Bayesians

A Bayesians, in the context of statistics, is an individual who adheres to the Bayesian interpretation of probability and statistical inference.

::: fragment
Probability is obtained by likelihood of an event to occur, given data and prior knowledge.
