## Learning Outcomes

-   Announcements

-   Data

-   Measurements

-   Penguins

# Announcements

## Expected Study Time

You should spend 2-3 hours per unit of registered class.

For Math 201, spend 8-12 hours to succeed.

## Math Minds

# Data

## Population

A population is the entire group that we want to know more about.

## Sample

A sample is a subset of a population that is considered representative.

## Sample vs Population

## Experimental Unit

An experimental unit is one individual unit from a sample.

## Data

Data is information from a particular experimental unit. There can be more that one piece of information per experimental unit.

## Data Structure

The structure of the data can be represented in various forms:

-   A list of long numbers

-   Table

## Tabular Form

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
library(DT)
mtcars |> datatable(options = list(dom = "t",
                                   pageLength = 4))

```

# Measurements

## Measurements

Measurements are the processes where we represent an attribute of an experimental unit as either a number or category.

## Quantitative Measurements

Quantitative measurements are data measurements that take a numeric form.

## Qualitative Measurements

Qualitative measurements are data measurements that take a certain category.

## Value

A value is a description (number or category) of a specific attribute of an experimental unit.

## Variable

A variable is the descriptive attribute that we want to obtain from an experimental unit. In terms of a data set, the variable contains all the values of specific attribute in a sample.

# Penguins

## Palmer Penguins

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |> drop_na() |> 
  slice_sample(n = 6) |> 
  datatable(options = list(dom = "t",
                           pageLength = 6))

```

# Prediction

## Prediction

When you are given a large data set, what numbers do you want to know about?

What would these numbers tell you about the data?
