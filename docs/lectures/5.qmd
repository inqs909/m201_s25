# Probability Theory

## What is Probability?

**Probability** is the measure of how likely an event is to occur. It ranges from 0 to 1:
- $P(A) = 0$: The event $A$ will definitely not happen.
- $P(A) = 1$: The event $A$ will definitely happen.
- Values between 0 and 1 represent varying degrees of likelihood.

## Everyday Examples
- What’s the probability it will rain tomorrow?
- What are the chances of rolling a 6 on a standard die?
- How likely is it that a randomly chosen student has a GPA above 3.0?


## Key Terms and Definitions

::: panel-tabset

### **Experiment**
An action or process that generates outcomes.  
- Example: Rolling a die.

### **Sample Space**
The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.  
- Example: For rolling a die, $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.

### **Event**
A subset of the sample space, representing outcomes of interest.  
- Example: Rolling an even number ($A = \{2, 4, 6\}$).

### **Prob. of an Event**
The proportion of times an event is expected to occur if the experiment is repeated many times.

:::

## The Probability Formula

The probability of an event $A$ is defined as:

$$
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
$$

## Example
If we roll a die, what is the probability of rolling a 4?

- **Favorable outcomes**: 1 (rolling a 4).
- **Total outcomes**: 6 (since $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$).

$$
P(\text{rolling a 4}) = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167
$$


## Rules of Probability

::: panel-tabset

### Rule 1

**Probability of the Sample Space**

The probability of the sample space is always 1:
$$
P(S) = 1
$$

### Rule 2 

**Probability of Impossible Events**

The probability of an event that cannot happen is 0:
$$
P(\emptyset) = 0
$$

### Rule 3

**Complement Rule**

The probability of the complement of an event $A$ (not $A$) is:

$$
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
$$
- Example: If $P(\text{rain}) = 0.3$, then $P(\text{no rain}) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$.

### Rule 4

**Addition Rule**

For two events $A$ and $B$:
- If $A$ and $B$ are **mutually exclusive** (cannot happen at the same time):
$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$

- If $A$ and $B$ are **not mutually exclusive**:

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$

### Rule 5

**Multiplication Rule**

For two events $A$ and $B$:
- If $A$ and $B$ are **independent**:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
$$

## Applications

::: panel-tabset

### Drawing a Card
If you draw a card from a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing:

1. A heart?  
  $$
   P(\text{heart}) = \frac{13}{52} = 0.25
  $$

2. A red card (heart or diamond)?  
  $$
   P(\text{red card}) = \frac{26}{52} = 0.5
  $$

### Tossing a Coin Twice
What is the probability of getting:

1. Exactly one head?  
   Sample space: $S = \{\text{HH, HT, TH, TT}\}$.  
   Event: $A = \{\text{HT, TH}\}$.  
   $$
   P(A) = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5
   $$

2. At least one head?  
   Event: $B = \{\text{HH, HT, TH}\}$.  
   $$
   P(B) = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
   $$

### Traffic Lights
A commuter encounters three traffic lights, each with a 70% chance of being green. Assuming independence, what is the probability that all three lights are green?

$$
P(\text{all green}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.7 \cdot 0.7 = 0.343
$$

# Distribution Functions

## Distribution Functions

A **distribution function** describes the probabilities of a random variable across its possible values. It answers questions like:

- How likely is a random variable to take on a specific value or fall within a range?
- What is the overall "shape" of the distribution of outcomes?

## Types of Distribution Functions

::: panel-tabset

### **Discrete Distribution**

Used for **discrete random variables**, which can take on countable values (e.g., integers). Examples include:

- Number of heads in coin tosses.
- Number of customers in a store.

### **Continuous Distribution**
Used for **continuous random variables**, which can take on any value within a range (e.g., real numbers). Examples include:

- Heights of people.
- Time it takes to complete a task.

:::

## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** describes the probability that a random variable $X$ is less than or equal to a certain value $x$:
$$
F_X(x) = P(X \leq x)
$$

## Properties of the CDF

1. **Range**: The CDF is always between 0 and 1:
   $$
   0 \leq F_X(x) \leq 1
   $$
2. **Non-Decreasing**: The CDF never decreases as $x$ increases.
3. **Limits**:
   - $\lim_{x \to -\infty} F_X(x) = 0$
   - $\lim_{x \to \infty} F_X(x) = 1$

## CDF Example

For a die roll (discrete case):

- $F_X(2) = P(X \leq 2) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6}$.

For a normal distribution (continuous case):

- Use the CDF to find probabilities, typically provided via tables or software.


## Probability Density Function (PDF)

The **Probability Density Function (PDF)** is used for **continuous random variables** and describes the likelihood of the variable falling within a small interval.

$$
P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f_X(x) \, dx
$$

## Properties of the PDF:

1. **Non-Negative**:
   $$
   f_X(x) \geq 0 \quad \forall x
   $$

2. **Total Area Under Curve**:
   $$
   \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_X(x) \, dx = 1
   $$

## PDF Examples

The PDF of the normal distribution is:
$$
f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

Here, $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.



## Probability Mass Function (PMF)

The **Probability Mass Function (PMF)** is used for **discrete random variables** and gives the probability of each possible value:
$$
P(X = x) = p_X(x)
$$

## Properties of the PMF
1. **Non-Negative**:
   $$
   p_X(x) \geq 0 \quad \forall x
   $$

2. **Sum of Probabilities**:
   $$
   \sum_x p_X(x) = 1
   $$

## PMF Example

For a fair die, the PMF is:
$$
p_X(x) = \frac{1}{6}, \quad x \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
$$


## Applications

::: panel-tabset

### PMF of a Coin Toss
For a fair coin tossed once:
- $ X = 0 $: Tails, $ P(X = 0) = 0.5 $
- $ X = 1 $: Heads, $ P(X = 1) = 0.5 $

The PMF is:
$$
p_X(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
0.5 & x = 0 \text{ or } x = 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$


### CDF of an Exponential Distribution
An exponential random variable with rate $ \lambda > 0 $ has a CDF:
$$
F_X(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 - e^{-\lambda x}, & x \geq 0 \\
0, & x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

This can be used to model waiting times between events.

### Applications in Real Life
1. **PMF**:
   - Number of emails received per hour.
2. **PDF**:
   - Heights of students in a class.
3. **CDF**:
   - The likelihood of completing a task within a certain time frame.

# Normal Distribution

## Normal Distribution

The **Normal Distribution** is a probability distribution that is symmetric, with most of the data points clustering around the mean. 

- It’s **bell-shaped** and is defined mathematically by two parameters:
  - **Mean ($\mu$)**: The center or peak of the distribution.
  - **Standard Deviation ($\sigma$)**: Controls the spread of the distribution.


::: fragment
::: callout-important
For any normally distributed data, the highest probability density is at the mean, and as you move away from the mean, the probability density gradually decreases.
:::
:::

## Properties


1. **Symmetry**: It is perfectly symmetric about the mean, meaning the left side is a mirror image of the right.
2. **Unimodal**: There is a single peak at the mean.
3. **Mean, Median, and Mode are Equal**: In a normal distribution, these three measures of central tendency are located at the same point.
4. **68-95-99.7 Rule** (Empirical Rule): 
   - About **68%** of data falls within **one standard deviation** of the mean.
   - About **95%** of data falls within **two standard deviations**.
   - About **99.7%** of data falls within **three standard deviations**.

::: notes

This rule helps us understand how data is distributed in a normal curve and provides a quick way to estimate probabilities for normally distributed data.

## Normal Distribution

## The Standard Normal Distribution

The **Standard Normal Distribution** is a special type of normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It's often used as a reference to convert any normal distribution to a standard form.

## Z-Scores
A **Z-score** (or standard score) tells us how many standard deviations an individual data point is from the mean. It’s calculated as:

$$
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

- If $Z$ is positive, the data point is above the mean.
- If $Z$ is negative, the data point is below the mean.
- Using Z-scores, we can compare values across different normal distributions or find the probability associated with a particular score.


## Why the Normal Distribution is Important


1. **It Describes Many Natural Phenomena**: Heights, weights, test scores, measurement errors, and countless other variables follow a normal distribution, especially when influenced by many small, random factors.
2. **Predictive Power**: With normally distributed data, we can make predictions and infer probabilities, thanks to the 68-95-99.7 rule.
3. **Central Limit Theorem**: The normal distribution is foundational to the Central Limit Theorem, which tells us that, regardless of the original data distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution as sample size increases.
4. **Ease of Use in Statistical Methods**: Many statistical tests and methods assume normality, allowing for simplified calculations and reliable inferences.


## Applications of the Normal Distribution

::: panel-tabset

### Standardized Testing
Scores on standardized tests, such as IQ tests or the SAT, are often designed to follow a normal distribution. By knowing a student’s score in terms of Z-scores, we can determine their percentile or how they compare to other test-takers.

### Finance
In finance, stock returns and other economic factors are often modeled with a normal distribution to estimate risk, forecast trends, and make informed investment decisions.

# Empirical Rule


## What is the Empirical Rule?

The **Empirical Rule** provides a way to understand the spread of data in a normal distribution by describing how data points cluster around the mean. According to this rule:

1. Approximately **68%** of data points fall within **one standard deviation** of the mean.
2. Approximately **95%** of data points fall within **two standard deviations** of the mean.
3. Approximately **99.7%** of data points fall within **three standard deviations** of the mean.

The empirical rule is very helpful because, with just the mean and standard deviation, we can quickly estimate how data is distributed within a normal curve.


## Applying the Empirical Rule to the Normal Distribution

Let’s define the key terms and apply the empirical rule to the normal distribution.

- **Mean (μ)**: This is the central point of the normal distribution where the data clusters around.
- **Standard Deviation (σ)**: This is a measure of how spread out the data points are from the mean.

In a normal distribution:
- **68% of data** lies between $(\mu - \sigma)$ and $(\mu + \sigma)$.
- **95% of data** lies between $(\mu - 2\sigma)$ and $(\mu + 2\sigma)$.
- **99.7% of data** lies between $(\mu - 3\sigma)$ and $(\mu + 3\sigma)$.

These intervals allow us to estimate probabilities for data within each range without needing to calculate exact probabilities.


## Visualizing the Empirical Rule

To better understand the empirical rule, imagine a symmetric, bell-shaped normal curve. Here’s how it would look based on the empirical rule:

1. The **68% region** represents the middle of the curve, starting one standard deviation left of the mean and ending one standard deviation right.
2. The **95% region** stretches further out, covering almost the entire curve except for the outer tails.
3. The **99.7% region** includes nearly all data points, covering the entire curve except for a tiny fraction at each extreme.

This visualization shows how the data is most concentrated around the mean, with less data appearing as we move further away.


## Using the Empirical Rule for Probabilities

The empirical rule helps us answer questions like:

- **What percentage of data points fall within a certain range?**
- **How unusual is a data point located far from the mean?**

For example:
- If we know that a data point lies more than two standard deviations away from the mean, we know it’s in the outer 5% of the distribution, making it relatively rare.
- Using the rule, we can estimate that around 95% of values should lie within two standard deviations of the mean. If we observe data points outside of this range, we might consider them outliers.


## Examples

::: panel-tabset

### Exam Scores
Suppose exam scores are normally distributed with a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 10.
- **68% of students** scored between **60 and 80** (70 ± 10).
- **95% of students** scored between **50 and 90** (70 ± 20).
- **99.7% of students** scored between **40 and 100** (70 ± 30).

### Heights of Adults
Assume that adult heights follow a normal distribution with a mean height of 170 cm and a standard deviation of 8 cm.
- **68% of adults** have heights between **162 cm and 178 cm** (170 ± 8).
- **95% of adults** have heights between **154 cm and 186 cm** (170 ± 16).
- **99.7% of adults** have heights between **146 cm and 194 cm** (170 ± 24).

Using the empirical rule, we can see how most adult heights fall within predictable ranges around the mean.

# Binomial Distribution

## Binomial Distribution

The **Binomial Distribution** is a probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of trials, where each trial has:
- **Two possible outcomes**: typically called "success" and "failure."
- A constant probability of success, $ p $, on each trial.

### Real-World Examples:
- Tossing a coin $ n $ times and counting how many heads you get.
- Rolling a die $ n $ times and counting how many times you roll a 6.
- Administering a medical treatment to $ n $ patients and recording how many recover.

The binomial distribution answers questions like:
- "What is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin tosses?"
- "What is the likelihood of at least 4 successes in 10 trials?"


## Conditions for a Binomial Experiment

A binomial experiment must satisfy these four conditions:

1. **Fixed Number of Trials** ($ n $):
   - The experiment consists of a set number of trials.

2. **Two Possible Outcomes**:
   - Each trial results in either a success (e.g., heads) or a failure (e.g., tails).

3. **Constant Probability of Success** ($ p $):
   - The probability of success remains the same for each trial.

4. **Independence**:
   - The outcome of one trial does not affect the outcomes of other trials.

If these conditions are met, the binomial distribution is the right model to use.


## The Binomial Probability Formula

The probability of observing exactly $ k $ successes in $ n $ trials is given by the **binomial probability formula**:

$$
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

Where:
- $ P(X = k) $: Probability of exactly $ k $ successes.
- $ n $: Number of trials.
- $ k $: Number of successes.
- $ p $: Probability of success on a single trial.
- $ 1-p $: Probability of failure.
- $ \binom{n}{k} $: Binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose $ k $ successes from $ n $ trials. It’s calculated as:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$


### Example Calculation
Suppose you flip a fair coin 5 times ($ n = 5, p = 0.5 $) and want to know the probability of getting exactly 3 heads ($ k = 3 $).

Using the formula:

$$
P(X = 3) = \binom{5}{3} (0.5)^3 (1-0.5)^{5-3}
$$

1. Calculate $ \binom{5}{3} $:
$$
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{120}{6 \cdot 2} = 10
$$

2. Plug into the formula:
$$
P(X = 3) = 10 (0.5)^3 (0.5)^2 = 10 (0.125)(0.25) = 0.3125
$$
Examples and 
So, the probability of getting exactly 3 heads is **0.3125**, or 31.25%.

## Key Properties of the Binomial Distribution

### Mean and Variance
For a binomial random variable $ X $:
- **Mean (Expected Value)**: $ \mu = n \cdot p $
- **Variance**: $ \sigma^2 = n \cdot p \cdot (1-p) $
- **Standard Deviation**: $ \sigma = \sqrt{n \cdot p \cdot (1-p)} $

### Shape of the Distribution
- If $ p = 0.5 $, the distribution is symmetric.
- If $ p > 0.5 $, the distribution is skewed left.
- If $ p < 0.5 $, the distribution is skewed right.


## Applications

::: panel-tabset

### Quality Control
A factory produces lightbulbs, and 95% of them meet quality standards. If you randomly test 10 bulbs, what is the probability that exactly 8 bulbs pass the test?

Here:
- $ n = 10 $, $ p = 0.95 $, $ k = 8 $.

Using the formula, calculate:
$$
P(X = 8) = \binom{10}{8} (0.95)^8 (0.05)^2
$$

### Sports
A basketball player has a 60% chance of making a free throw. If they take 5 shots, what is the probability of making at least 3 shots?

Here:
- $ n = 5 $, $ p = 0.6 $.
- We calculate $ P(X \geq 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) $.

### Clinical Trials
In a clinical trial, a new drug has a 70% success rate. If 15 patients are treated, what is the probability that exactly 10 respond positively to the treatment?

# Poisson Distribution


## Poisson Distribution

The **Poisson Distribution** is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of events occurring within a fixed interval. These events must happen independently and at a constant average rate. 

### Real-World Examples:
- The number of emails you receive in an hour.
- The number of cars passing through a toll booth in 10 minutes.
- The number of defects in a square meter of fabric.

The Poisson distribution helps us answer questions like:
- "What is the probability of receiving 5 emails in the next hour?"
- "How likely is it to have 2 defects in a single square meter?"


## Conditions for Using the Poisson Distribution

To use the Poisson distribution, the following conditions must be met:

1. **Events Occur Randomly**:
   - The events are random and unpredictable.

2. **Independence**:
   - The occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of another event occurring.

3. **Constant Average Rate** ($ \lambda $):
   - The average number of events ($ \lambda $) over a fixed interval remains constant.

4. **Non-Overlapping Intervals**:
   - Events in one interval do not influence events in another.


## The Poisson Probability Formula

The probability of observing exactly $ k $ events in a fixed interval is given by the **Poisson probability formula**:

$$
P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

Where:
- $ P(X = k) $: Probability of $ k $ events occurring.
- $ \lambda $: Average number of events in the interval.
- $ e $: Euler's number ($ \approx 2.718 $).
- $ k! $: Factorial of $ k $, calculated as $ k \times (k-1) \times \dots \times 1 $.

### Example Calculation
Suppose a call center receives an average of 10 calls per hour ($ \lambda = 10 $). What is the probability of receiving exactly 7 calls in the next hour ($ k = 7 $)?

Using the formula:

$$
P(X = 7) = \frac{10^7 e^{-10}}{7!}
$$

1. Calculate $ e^{-10} \approx 0.0000454 $.
2. Compute $ 10^7 = 10,000,000 $.
3. Find $ 7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040 $.
4. Plug in the values:
$$
P(X = 7) = \frac{10,000,000 \cdot 0.0000454}{5040} \approx 0.0902
$$

So, the probability of receiving exactly 7 calls is approximately **9.02%**.


## Poisson Distribution Properties

### Mean and Variance
For a Poisson random variable $ X $:
- **Mean**: $ \mu = \lambda $
- **Variance**: $ \sigma^2 = \lambda $
- **Standard Deviation**: $ \sigma = \sqrt{\lambda} $

### Shape of the Distribution
- When $ \lambda $ is small, the distribution is highly skewed to the right.
- As $ \lambda $ increases, the distribution becomes more symmetric and resembles a normal distribution.


## Applications

::: panel-tabset

### Traffic Flow
A toll booth observes an average of 3 cars passing through every 5 minutes ($ \lambda = 3 $). What is the probability of seeing exactly 5 cars in the next 5 minutes?

Using the formula:
$$
P(X = 5) = \frac{3^5 e^{-3}}{5!} = \frac{243 \cdot 0.0498}{120} \approx 0.1008
$$

So, the probability is approximately **10.08%**.


### Defective Products
A factory produces an average of 2 defective items per day ($ \lambda = 2 $). What is the probability of finding no defective items in a day ($ k = 0 $)?

$$
P(X = 0) = \frac{2^0 e^{-2}}{0!} = e^{-2} \approx 0.1353
$$

So, there’s a **13.53% chance** of finding no defective items.



### Hospital Arrivals
On average, 4 patients arrive at an emergency room every hour ($ \lambda = 4 $). What is the probability of seeing more than 6 patients in an hour?

This is a cumulative probability:
$$
P(X > 6) = 1 - P(X \leq 6)
$$
You would calculate $ P(X \leq 6) $ by summing probabilities for $ P(X = 0) $ through $ P(X = 6) $ using the formula.
