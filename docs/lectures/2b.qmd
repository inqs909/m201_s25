# Sampling

## Sampling

Sampling is the process of selecting units from a population interest to collect data from.

## Sampling

When Sampling you want to maintain these properties:

-   Representative sample

-   Large enough sample size

## Sampling Example

We want to answer the question, are people happy?

## Random Sampling

When sampling, we strive for random sampling

-   Each unit in the population of interest must have an equal probability of being selected for the study.

-   This ensures a representative population

## Independent Sampling

In addition to random sampling, we strive to make sure each unit is independent from each other.

-   The probability of UNIT A being sampled will not affect the probability of UNIT B to be sampled.

## Sampling Variation

-   Random samples may vary from the population of interest.

-   Due to randomness, samples many not look the or biased.

-   However, this is to be expected as because the sample will not be biased in one way or another.

-   Samples are then considered unbiased as long as experimental units were collected randomly.

# Data Structure

## Data Structure

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |> drop_na() |> 
  datatable(options = list(dom = "tp",
                           pageLength = 6))
```

## Data

A data set can be manipulated in ways to make it easier to process:

-   `filter()`: allows you to remove rows that do not satisfy a certain condition

-   `select()`: select to view certain variables

-   `mutate()`: add a new variable to the data set based on a set of instructions

## Selecting a Variable

I am interested in viewing species, island, and body_mass_g in my data set:

```{r}
#| echo: true

select(penguins, species, island, body_mass_g)

```

## Filtering a Data Set

I am only interested in looking at the penguins with a body mass bigger than 4000 g:

```{r}
#| echo: true

penguins_over_4000 <- filter(penguins, body_mass_g > 4000)
select(penguins_over_4000, species, island, body_mass_g)
```

# Data Manipulation

## Data Manipulation

This is a process where we can manipulate the data when there are errors in the data recording process.

OR

Data must be formatted in a way for analysis (computer requirements).

## Missing Data

```{r}
penguins |>  select(species, island, body_mass_g) |> 
  datatable(options = list(dom = "tp",
                           pageLength = 6))
```

## Handling Missing Data

How do we handle missing data?

-   Remove the experimental unit

-   Take and educated guess what it is

    -   Replace with mean

    -   Single Imputation

    -   Multiple Imputation

## Handling Missing Data

For this class, we will remove the entire experimental unit.

```{r}
#| echo: true


# Obtaining the number of rows
nrow(penguins)

# Removing missing cases
penguins_missing_removed <- drop_na(penguins)
nrow(penguins_missing_removed)
```

## Summarizing Data

```{r}
rnorm(8, mean = 10, sd = 3) |> round(2)
```

How would a computer count how many values are greater than 10?

# Prediction

## Prediction

3, 4, 6, 2, 7, 9, 2, 0, 1, 4, 6, 2

List as many ways you can present the data to collaborators. With each method, what are the advantages and disadvantages?
